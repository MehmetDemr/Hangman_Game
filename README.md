# Hangman_Game
INTRODUCTION
The Hangman Game is a simple desktop application implemented in C# using Windows Forms. The game involves guessing a word by suggesting letters or attempting to guess the entire word. The player has a limited number of attempts (represented as health) to guess the word correctly. The difficulty level of the game can be selected, affecting the category of words to guess.

FEATURES
